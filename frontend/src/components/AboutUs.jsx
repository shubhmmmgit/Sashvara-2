        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Sashvara is more than just a clothing brand – it’s a dream stitched into reality. The name itself is a blend of Sakshi (our founder) and Vara (meaning blessings), symbolizing clothes made with love, purpose, and positivity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Our mission is simple: to create outfits that feel as good as they look. We design clothing that blends ethnic elegance with modern comfort, offering versatile pieces that anyone can wear – whether it’s for college, work, or casual outings.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          At Sashvara, we believe fashion should be minimal yet stylish, cozy yet statement-making. Every design is thoughtfully crafted to make you feel confident, comfortable, and effortlessly yourself.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Sashvara isn’t just about clothing. It’s about celebrating individuality, embracing comfort, and carrying a little blessing in every outfit you wear.
